    "1. Hover over `Web Access` in the sidebar navigation and click on `My APIs`.\n",
    "2. Click `Create API`.\n",
    "3. Select `SERP API` and click `Continue`.\n",
    "4. **Important**: Change the `Zone name` to `serp`. As of this writing (October 18, 2025), the `langchain-brightdata` package doesn't allow for configuring the zone name and uses `serp` by default. If you don't have a zone with the name `serp`, invocations with the tool will fail.\n",
    "5. Make sure that `CAPTCHA Solver` is enabled and the `Standard` option is selected.\n",
    "6. Click `Add API`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Add API Key to `.env`\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the API key and paste it as the value for `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_API_KEY` in the `.env` file."
